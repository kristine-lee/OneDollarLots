# One Dollar Lots map #

## ABOUT
Since Mayor Bill de Blasio took office on January 1st, 2014, the City of New York has sold 202 city-owned lots of land to housing developers for $1.00 each.
Some of this land has gone to organizations doing valuable and necessary work for the city— developing permanent homes for the extremely-low income, establishing shelters for LGBT youth. Some of this land has also gone to for-profit housing developers building market-rate apartments or "affordable" units too expensive for locals to live in. And these sales are happening with few opportunities for input from those most impacted. To date, only one of these lots has become permanently affordable housing.
The ONE DOLLAR LOTS project by 596 Acres is an archive of these $1 lot sales. It is also a place for organizers and local residents to get information about pending sales that may disrupt their communities and imagine better uses for cheap public land. 41 lots are still pending final sale.

## METHODOLOGY
Any time the City plans to sell public land for $1, it posts a "Disposition Notice" in the online City Records database. We tracked all of these notices posted since January 2014 and we added them to our "pending" list of $1 sales. Sometimes, we also found potential $1 sales in EDC board meeting mintues.
For each pending sale, we used the ACRIS database to check if the sale had taken place. A deed tells us when the land was sold and who it was sold to. Each time we found a deed, we transferred the $1 lot from our "pending" list to our "sold" list.
Also on ACRIS, each deed is posted along with a regulatory agreement that spells out certain restrictions on how the developer must use the land. This is crucial information: these agreements include what target incomes any new housing must be built for and how long these affordability restrictions last— good indicators of how useful new housing may be for the local community.
Take a look at the raw data here.

## USING THE MAP
In the upper-right, click on the map controls to toggle different layers on and off, zoom in and out, and locate an address.
Click on a point on the map to view all details regarding a $1 sale. To see general demographic information about the area the lot is in, click on the "Community District" link. To contact the local Council Member, click on the "City Council District" link.
When clicking on a point, make sure to look at the "Housing Restrictions" section and compare it to "Community District Income." This gives an idea of how useful this land sale may be to locals. Keep in mind: a non-profit developer is not necessarily serving the community well. If you need more detailed information on housing restrictions, click on the source link below the restrictions to see the proposal or agreement regarding the sale.

## WHY IT MATTERS
Public land is a priceless resource. Historically, it has been used by residents of NYC to create the places we know we need to survive and thrive. Kept public or given away cheaply to groups organized specifically to ensure long-term public benefit— like community land trusts— public land has become deeply and permanently affordable housing, community, cooperative, cultural and commercial spaces, and so much more. Public land is a great starting place for actualizing the city as commons!
These vacant city-owned lots that have been sold for $1 are vacant due to decades of institutionally racist land use policies including settler colonialism, redlining, and Urban Renewal Area clearance. Many of these lots languish in the middle of active blocks primarily in low-income neighborhoods of color, and they exist for years fenced off by the government but otherwise not maintained. Fast forward to 2014, and the city is selling them without input from the people who have long dealt with the real life impact of abandoned land in their lives. This squanders potential opportunities for transforming historical violence and for creating lasting, adaptive public benefit.
